# GIFKR
GIFKR is a simple Java based image, GIF, and video filtering platform.

This project was made by a single developer over the course of two years, so it is a bit disorganized. 
It does not use maven/gradle/etc. The entire Eclipse project (including dependencies) is in this repo.

To use it, simply clone the repo and then open it in Eclipse using File>Open Project From File System.
